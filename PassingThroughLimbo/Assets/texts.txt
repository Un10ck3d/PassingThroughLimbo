Story Text? (Skrevet af Sumaya) : -----------------------------

You wake up… You hear something… “Am I in a castle?” you ask yourself. “is this limbo?”. 
The castle looks old and abandoned. You slowly sit up. You see a black worm. 
You try going over the worm but the worm sends poison into your leg. You quickly try to get the poison out…. 
You succeed. The floor is covered with spikes. You feel something tickling you. You realize that you have wings. 
You try to go over the spikes. With your heart full of hope you try to go over the spikes. You close your eyes. 
When you open your eyes again you're at a place.... “hell?” you say to yourself. You see a red ball with wings and sharp teeth. 
The monster comes closer to you… It’s friendly...
